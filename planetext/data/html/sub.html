<p id="id1" class="ltx_p">This paper examines the performance of a Spatial Pooler (SP) of a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) in the task of noisy object recognition. To address this challenge, a dedicated custom-designed system based on the SP, histogram calculation module and SVM classifier was implemented. In addition to implementing their own version of HTM, the authors also designed a profiler which is capable of tracing all of the key parameters of the system. This was necessary, since an analysis and monitoring of the system performance turned out to be extremely difficult using conventional testing and debugging tools.</p>
<p id="id2" class="ltx_p">The system was initially trained on artificially prepared videos without noise and then tested with a set of noisy video streams. This approach was intended to mimic a real life scenario where an agent or a system trained to deal with ideal objects faces a task of classifying distorted and noisy ones in its regular working conditions.</p>
<p id="id3" class="ltx_p">The authors conduced a series of experiments for various macro parameters of HTM SP, as well as for different levels of video reduction ratios. The experiments allowed them to evaluate the performance of two different system setups (i.e. ’Multiple HTMs’ and ’Single HTM’) under various noise conditions with 32–frame video files. Results of all the tests were compared to SVM baseline setup.</p>
<p id="id4" class="ltx_p">It was determined that the system featuring SP is capable of achieving approximately 12 times the noise reduction for a video signal with with distorted bits accounting for 13% of the total. Furthermore, the system featuring SP performed better also in the experiments without a noise component and achieved a max F1 score of 0.96.
The experiments also revealed that a rise of column and synapse number of SP has a substantial impact on the performance of the system. Consequently, the highest F1 score values were obtained for 256 and 4096 synapses and columns respectively. It is worth noting that ’Multiple HTMs’ setup outperforms the ’Single HTM’ one. Nevertheless, this is achieved at the expense of increased computational demands.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The world consists of objects that interact dynamically with each other to form a network of complex relationships. It should be noted that virtually all processes in the real world develop in time; even the ones that appear to be fixed, after careful analysis in the micro–scale, turn out to be dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The eyes are the basic and primary tool for examining the world with which the nature equipped virtually all the living creatures capable of moving by themselves.
Closer examination of species’ evolution on Earth show that a huge leap forward occurred around the time when the fist primitive eyes were developed which happened about 540 million years ago <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">wiki:Eye ()</a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Stationary images, even ones of a very high resolution and great number of low level details, provide limited information regarding an analyzed scene and objects within it. They lack a temporal component that is essential to follow how the objects change in time, which in turn provides complete information of its nature. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the human brain was well adapted for processing dynamic object interactions. The important role that the dimension of time plays in analyzing visual objects is also reflected in the tissue structure, 80% of which involves temporal connections <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mountcastle ()</a></cite>. Consequently, when analyzing static scenes our eyes make rapid, step–like rotation, following which the eyes remain stationary. The series of step movements are known as saccades or saccadic eye movements.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The real world is highly noisy and imperfect, thus the brain was designed to analyze such distorted streams of images. It is able to learn to distinguish between heavily malformed and noisy objects in the space we live in. This is possible due to a long and complicated process of training, during which the brain is exposed to streams of data in large quantities and learns to extract the perfect shapes of objects from the noisy ones. The process may be perceived as discovering latent features which are unique and invariant for a given object or set of objects. The idea behind this approach resembles to some extent the methods used for training the latest deep learning algorithms. A sufficiently large amount of stationary images are used to compensate for the lack of a temporal component in exploring latent features of the processed objects. This phenomenon contributed to the recent breakthrough in Very Deep Learning architecture training which is mostly driven by the availability of a huge amount of data and GPU computational power <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">Krizhevsky ()</a>; <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">Schmidhuber ()</a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The brain, in an effort to classify distorted images, compares the ideal version of the objects encoded in Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) with the noisy ones. The authors decided to investigate to what extent this mechanism is effectively implemented in Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). The bio-inspired algorithm, which models a selected section of neocortex <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Numenta ()</a></cite> using state–of–the–art knowledge in neurobiology regarding the human brain.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The hypothesis which the paper attempts to confirm states that <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">incorporating SP of HTM in video processing flow increases the overall noise robustness of system</span>.</p>

<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The human brain as a whole has not been completely explored yet, making its artificial implementation and verification a very hard task. However, there are initiatives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">humanbrainproject ()</a></cite> which have taken up the challenge of simulating and modeling the brain as we know it today. Rather than model the brain, the authors of this paper have adopted a slightly different approach of gradually introducing selected components of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) to the video processing system with the intention of enhancing its performance. By doing so we aim to develop a complete system<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">online:custom_htm ()</a></cite> working on the principles of the human brain as they were presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">Mountcastle ()</a>; <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Numenta ()</a></cite> with our modification making the algorithm suitable for hardware implementation. Running HTM on CPU is very slow, and due to its strongly parallel structure the algorithm is a good candidate for General–Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and Field–Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) acceleration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">pietron2016parallel ()</a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">pietron2016formal ()</a></cite>.

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) replicates the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. It can be regarded as a memory system which is not programmed, but trained through exposing it to data flow. The process of training is similar to the way humans learn which, in its essence, is about finding latent causes in the acquired content. At the beginning, the HTM has no knowledge of the data stream causes it examines, but through a learning process it explores the causes and captures them in its structure. The training is considered complete when all the latent causes of data are captured and stable. The detailed presentation of HTM is provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Numenta ()</a>; <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">Chen ()</a>; <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">Rachkovskij ()</a></cite>.

<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">HTM constitutes a hierarchy of nodes, where each node performs the same algorithm. The most basic elements (raw and unprocessed data) enter at the bottom of the hierarchy. Each node learns the spatio–temporal pattern of its input and associates it with a given concept. Consequently, each node, no matter where it is in the hierarchy, discovers the causes of its input.
In an HTM, beliefs exist at all levels in the hierarchy and are internal states of each node. They represent probabilities that a cause is active. Each node in an HTM has a fixed number of concepts and a fixed number of output variables. The training process of an HTM starts with a fixed number of possible causes, and in a training process, assigns a meaning to them.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, the nodes do not increase the number of concepts they cover; instead, over the course of the training, the meaning of the outputs gradually changes. This happens at all levels in the hierarchy simultaneously. Thus the top level of the hierarchy remains with little or no meaning till nodes at the bottom are trained to recognize the basic patterns.</p>

Those steps may be described as mappings between spaces which are progressively narrowed to extract features to be used in the further processing stages that come after SP.
It is important to note that all the operations presented in this section consider SP after training is accomplished, which means that learning is not taken into account.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An HTM object itself consists of a configurable number of layers, a Spatial Pooler and a Temporal Pooler object. Upon each iteration, each layer state is updated by the SP and (depending on the configuration) the TP, based on the data it receives. In the case of the lowest layer the input is obtained from the encoder, and for the higher ones – from the previous level. Setting the layer number to zero effectively turns off the HTM, causing the whole module’s output to be equal to that of the encoder. This feature was used when comparing performance of ’SVM’ only with the ’SP + SVM’ ensemble.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Layers consist of columns, which are composed of connectors (containing synapses used in the spatial pooling process) and cells (used in temporal pooling). Cells themselves are built from segments, with each segment containing synapses connecting it to the other cells.

<p id="S3.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Every object encapsulates its functionality, making introduction of changes and enhancements trivial, while at the same time providing a clear reference point for modifications. The object-oriented structure also enhances the visibility of a very important HTM feature – its potential for massive parallelization. One example of that can be a spatial pooling process. The initial system setup used a sequential version of SP. After some tests, a decision to replace it with a concurrent implementation running on a GPU (and an FPGA in the future) was made. The replacement spatial pooler, taking advantage of OpenCL capabilities, was written and plugged into the system without changes to the rest of the architecture.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Debugging a conventional system is a relatively simple and well-established practice. Challenges arise when addressing other than the von Neumann architectures, such as HTM. In those cases, it is necessary to use unconventional methods and tools, often specifically designed to debug and analyze the particular application. The authors have faced the same challenges during the early stages of the system development. The initially designed tool that allowed them to analyze individual columns and synapses did not allow for effective tracing of the module behavior, because the system as a whole behaves statistically. Therefore, the authors decided to develop a tool that can globally profile the whole HTM system. It consists of two modules: an analyzer and a visualizer. The first one stores system operating parameters (e.g. active inputs), while the second is responsible for data presentation in a form easily understandable to the designer of the HTM system. Example visualizations are shown in Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Debugging ‣ 5 Experiments and the discussion ‣ Noisy video classification with Spatial Pooler of Hierarchical Temporal Memory" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> – <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.2 Debugging ‣ 5 Experiments and the discussion ‣ Noisy video classification with Spatial Pooler of Hierarchical Temporal Memory" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The challenging part involved generation of sample videos for testing. The videos had to meet a series of requirements such as object location, camera location and object–camera distance. Consequently, a dedicated application was used to generate the videos (i.e. Blender <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">blender ()</a></cite>). Blender provides Python API, which allowed authors to automate and randomize the video generation. Consequently, a series of videos were generated of 960x540 pixels each. All the footages contain a single, centered, stationary object with the camera moving around it in all directions and at varying distance. The sample frames are presented in Fig <a href="#S5.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 5.3 Datasets ‣ 5 Experiments and the discussion ‣ Noisy video classification with Spatial Pooler of Hierarchical Temporal Memory" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the experiments, three datasets (available online <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">online:datasets ()</a></cite>) based on the rendered videos were created: R16, R8 and R4, with frame sizes 60x32, 120x66 and 240x134 respectively.
Subsequently, a Gaussian noise was introduced to the testing videos. Since noise addition at the runtime proved to be a very time consuming process, a separate script introducing noise to a large set of generated videos was created.</p>

Average values were calculated for each class separately as well as for all the videos combined, discarding samples for which cosine similarity could not be calculated.
It should be noted that with increasing levels of noise, SP filtration efficiency decreases, which is expected. In order to increase or maintain its previous efficiency of noise reduction, some of the macro parameters of the system should be tuned to increase selectivity of the module and boost noise elimination.</p>

It is worth noting the performance of the system depends both on noise level and reduction rate. As expected, a larger reduction ratio degrades performance of SP + SVM because less data is available. Furthermore, image preprocessing operations and especially binarization introduces distortions which are proportional to the noise level. SP + SVM setup is particularly sensitive to relocation distortions i.e. changing spatial positions of pixels in the data fed into the module.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents the experimental results of using an HTM–based system for object classification in noisy video streams. The authors showed that using SP in the video processing flow improves the object classification ratio by more than 10% and achieves approximately 12 times the noise reduction for a video signal with 13% distorted bits. It was determined that a rise of column and synapse number of SP has a substantial impact on the performance of the system and the best results were obtained for 256 and 4096 synapses and columns, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In future research, the authors plan to expand the work to test the system with more advanced benchmarks featuring real-live video streams. Such experiments were not done for this paper because we needed to verify operation of the video classification module in ideal conditions and adjust the basic parameters of the system. The authors are also going to replace the binarization operation with a custom–designed encoder and enhance the SVM classifier with a dedicated decoder. Experiments with several stacked SP layers extended with TP are also scheduled for future improvements of the system. However, in order to be able to examine performance of such configurations, the remaining computationally–exhaustive routines will have to be ported to OpenCL and the system will have to be deployed on platforms equipped with GPU or FPGA. This will enable conduction of experiments with video of a lower image reduction ratio.</p>
