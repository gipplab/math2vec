Abstract In this Nice Paper we report on the first five out of eleven observations in our programme of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of old nova shells. We present new WFPC2 images of the shells around FH Ser and V533 Her taken in the F656N (Hmath-alpha +[N II]) filter. We also show long-slit spectra taken using the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in La Palma for these objects in the same spectral range. The shell around FH Ser is found to be a prolate ellipsoid of ellipticity 1.30.1 inclined at 624 to the line of sight. The shell has an equatorial ring which is found to be due to increased emission in the two [N II] lines rather than Hmath-alpha . The expansion velocity is best modelled by a true equatorial expansion rate of 49020 km s. The best-fitting systemic velocity is 45 km s. A synthetic image and synthetic spectra are also presented for this model for comparison with our observations. We derive a distance to FH Ser of 95050 pc. The origin of the [N II] equatorial ring is discussed in the context of a photoionization feature resulting from aspherical illumination by the central source rather than a simple density enhancement. It is possible however that the ring is also in part due to an extremely localised increase in the nitrogen abundance. The brightest part of the shell was found to have a surface brightness of  erg cm s arcsec. Similar imaging and spectroscopy of the nova V533 Her reveal a shell of radius  arcsec with an axial ratio of  and peak surface brightness  erg cm s arcsec. The expansion velocity of this shell is  km s and the distance is estimated to be  pc. The shells around BT Mon, DK Lac and V476 Cyg were not detected with HST implying 3math-sigma  upper limits to the surface brightness in Hmath-alpha +[N II] of 5.3–6.3 erg cm s arcsec.
Every classical nova outburst should result in the ejection of  to math-M_{direct-product}  of material at velocities of the order of hundreds to thousands of kilometres per second (Bode & Evans 1989). Study of these expanding shells of nova ejecta has importance for a range of astrophysical areas including the physics of thermonuclear reactions, mixing mechanisms, nebular shaping, radiation-driven winds, clumping mechanisms, astrophysical chemistry and the formation of dust. Novae provide a real-time laboratory in which these processes can be investigated. The work presented in this series of papers builds on our ground-based imaging survey of the ejecta of old novae using 4-m class telescopes (Slavin, O’Brien & Dunlop 1995, Gill & O’Brien 1998) in two ways. Firstly we present high-resolution imaging obtained with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This is then complemented by kinematical information obtained from spatially-resolved spectroscopy using the William Herschel and Anglo-Australian Telescopes (WHT & AAT respectively).
This first paper presents the HST images and medium-resolution long-slit WHT spectra of the shells of FH Ser and V533 Her in the region of Hmath-alpha . We also present non-detections in the HST imaging of BT Mon, DK Lac and V476 Cyg. §2 describes the observations and §3 presents the results. The data are interpreted and discussed in §4. The corresponding observations of HR Del, RR Pic, T Aur, V1500 Cyg and V842 Cen will be presented in papers to follow.
